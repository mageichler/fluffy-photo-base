# Fluffy photo base

Published here: (https://mageichler.github.io/fluffy-photo-base/)

Welcome to my very first React.js app! This is also my final project from programming classes. I still working on improving some features so at this moment I kindly ask you to be patient and forgiving if something doesn't work perfectly.

## Project stages & used tools

### Pen and paper
I've started by designing a simple app that will be focused on browsing and searching animal photos from Unsplash base, using its API.

Basic assumptions:
1. This app should comfort the user by showing only safe and fluffy pets and wild animals photos.
2. User can both browse photos by categories or use the search bar.
3. Every category (or page with search results) should have an infinite scroll instead of pagination.
4. Every photo user can see on a separate page with more details.
5. Also, user can every photo download, like and share with friends.

### The prototype

Here you can see [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/eK471bP5wO8F8Tgn1xlqsA/js-app-gallery-of-fluffiness?node-id=10%3A13&viewport=-1331%2C761%2C1.1868277788162231&frame-preset-name=MacBook&scaling=scale-down-width&page-id=0%3A1).

### The coding part

Through the programming course, I've learnt a lot and put (almost) everything in this project like fetch for data from API, using components life cycle stages etc. etc. As a curious person, I've also put some tricks and knowledge found on the internet like using icon libraries or CSS variables.

Also, as our mentor recommended, I've used the Styled Components library to put CSS directly into .js files.

I want to show this app to the world, so I have a 'create Github page' on my checklist.

### Adding more fluffy photos

As a huge fan of fluffy photo browsers, I've decided to add more photo bases to my app. Like Pexels. But this is the song of the future now.

## Current app state

At this moment, I can say that basic functions are working, I've also made it a little bit rsponsive (not much, there is a possibility that not everything is perfect on smaller screens). I still have some things on my checklist but it is a moment when I want to show it on Github Pages.
